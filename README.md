# Predictive Modeling of Permit Processing Times for Corporations 

## Part 1: Brooklyn, NY

This repository contains all code used to answer a predictive modeling question as part of an exploratory analyses of [data from NYC's Department of Buildings](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-Permit-Issuance/ipu4-2q9a).

The folders are structured in line with the initial report, which is also present as a *PDF* document in the root directory of this repository (**.pdf**).

**Note**: The code seen here was executed in a Jupyter notebook due to their interactive nature, and hence may not be fully executable as a python script.
