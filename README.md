# ToposAssignment

This repository contains all code used to answer a predictive modeling question as part of Topos' take-home data assignment.

The folders are structured according to the final report, which is also present in the root directory of this repository.

**Note**: The code seen here was executed in a Jupyter notebook due to their interactive nature, and hence may not be executable as a python script.
